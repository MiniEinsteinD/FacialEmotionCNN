# FacialEmotionCNN

This is my solution to one of the assignments from my ML class

The dataset used can be found on Kaggle: FER-2013 - The link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

Creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of accurately identifying and interpreting subtle facial cues.

Meet Dr. Emily Hayes(üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è), a leading psychologist who specializes in treating patients with various emotional disorders. Despite her expertise, Dr. Hayes often finds it challenging to accurately assess her patients' emotions during therapy sessions. Traditional methods, such as self-reporting and facial expressions, can be unreliable and subjective.

Determined to find a more effective solution, Dr. Hayes hears of James Green who works with a team of data scientists and engineers that can develop an emotion recognition model based on the Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) image dataset. This dataset contains thousands of facial images labelled with six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear (plus 'neutral').

Together, they embark on a journey to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of accurately identifying and interpreting subtle facial cues. Their goal is to build a tool that can assist therapists like Dr. Hayes in better understanding their patients' emotions and providing more targeted interventions.
